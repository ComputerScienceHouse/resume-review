## Overview

Resume Review is a web app written for [CSH](https://csh.rit.edu/) members to
upload their resumes and receive feedback on them. Members can prepare for
career fairs, company visits, and job applications by running their resumes by
their peers, requesting specific changes or just asking for general opinions.

The site was made using Express, a Node.js framework. It runs on CSHâ€™s
OpenShift Origin cluster, uses our internal S3 to store files, and stores
metadata and comments in a PostgreSQL database.

See my blog post about it on CSH's blog [here](https://blog.csh.rit.edu/2018/04/30/resume-review/).

## Developing locally

Create `nodemon.json` with the following environment variables filled in:
```
{
  "env": {
    "PORT": "",
    "DB_NAME": "",
    "DB_USERNAME": "",
    "DB_PASSWORD": "",
    "S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "",
    "S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "",
    "S3_URL": "",
    "S3_BUCKET": "",
    "OIDC_CLIENT_ID": "",
    "OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET": "",
    "OIDC_CALLBACK_URL": "",
    "OIDC_SESSION_SECRET": "",
    "ADMINS": "",
    "SMTP_HOST": "",
    "SMTP_PORT": ,
    "SMTP_USERNAME": "",
    "SMTP_PASSWORD": ""
  }
}
```

Note: For local development, be sure to set OIDC_CALLBACK_URL to exactly `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback` or `http://localhost:4200/auth/callback`.

If you are deadset on using something else, you will need to reach out to a Computer Science House Root Type Person first.


and run `npm install`, then `nodemon resume-review`.
